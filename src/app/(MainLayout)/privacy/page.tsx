              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                When you register for an account through our Services, we will collect personal information that you
                provide us, such as your name, email address, phone number, and password. When you sign up for our
                Services or make a purchase through the Services, we will collect payment, shipping and billing
                information (for example, credit card number and expiration date) to process your transaction. In
                addition, we collect the name and birth date of any customer, including any children, joining our book
                club if you subscribe to the Service.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                If you purchase a gift for another recipient through our Services, we or our third party payment provider
                will collect payment information. We will collect the sender's and gift recipient's names, if provided, as
                well as a personal message, if provided. We also collect the recipient's email address if the gift is to
                be delivered electronically.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                When you receive a shipment, we record which books you keep and which you return (if applicable). If you
                provide us feedback or contact us via email, we will collect your name and email address, as well as any
                other content included in the email.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                We may combine personal information collected through the Services with other information that we or third
                parties collect about you in other contextsâ€”such as our communications with you via email or phone, or
                your customer service records. We will treat such combined information as personal information and protect
                it in accordance with this Policy.

                From time to time, we may ask users of the Services to participate in surveys, contests, or promotions.
                Such surveys, contests, and promotions may be used to collect both personal and non-personal information.
                Participation is completely voluntary, and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose your
                information.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                When you visit our Site, some information is automatically collected. As is true of most websites, we
                gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP
                addresses, browser type (including the "User Agent" string), referring/exit and destination pages,
                date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to maintain and improve the performance of
                the Services.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                Like many online services, we also use cookies to collect information. "Cookies" are small pieces of
                information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may
                use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay
                on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on
                our Site or with our Service. This type of information is collected to make the Services more useful to
                you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                We work with a number of marketing companies that assist in marketing our services to you on third party
                websites. These companies may collect information about online activities conducted on a particular
                computer, browser or device over time and across third-party websites or online services for the purpose
                of delivering advertising that is likely to be of greater interest to you. While not a comprehensive list,
                some of these marketing companies we work with are Facebook and Google. If you would like more information
                about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies,
                visit http://choice.org.
              </p>
              <p className="leading-relaxed">
                We also work with a number of third party analytics companies that collect information anonymously and
                report website trends without identifying individual visitors. These services allow us to view a variety
                of reports about how visitors interact with the Services so we can improve our Services and understand how
                people find and navigate our Site. Currently, we work with the following analytics companies: Google,
                Facebook, MailChimp and Mixpanel. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list and we may stop working
                with these companies and work with others without notice. You can learn more about these analytics
                companies' privacy policies and opt out of data collection at their respective websites.
